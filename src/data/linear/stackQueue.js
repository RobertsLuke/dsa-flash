        question: "What is a Stack and how does it work?",
        answer: "A **Stack** is a collection of objects organized with **Last-In First-Out (LIFO)** principle.\n\n**Key Points:**\n* Only the most recently inserted object can be removed\n* Last-In First-Out structure\n* Common operations: push (insert), pop (remove), peek (view top)"

        question: "What is a Queue and how does it work?",
        answer: "A **Queue** is a collection of objects organized with **First-In First-Out (FIFO)** principle.\n\n**Key Points:**\n* Object stored longest is removed first\n* First-In First-Out structure\n* Common operations: enqueue (insert), dequeue (remove), peek (view front)"

        category: 'Priority Queue',
        question: "What is a Priority Queue and what are its time complexities?",
        answer: "A **Priority Queue** is a queue where elements have associated priorities.\n\n**Time Complexities:**\n* **Insertion:** O(1)\n* **Removal:** O(n) - must search for highest priority\n\n**Key Points:**\n* Elements have priorities\n* Highest priority element is removed first\n* Sequential search needed for removal"

          { id: 'a', text: 'First-In First-Out (FIFO)' },

          { id: 'd', text: 'Priority-based access' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'b',
        explanation: "A Stack follows the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. This is like a stack of plates where you can only take from the top."

        explanation: "A Queue follows the First-In First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed. This is like a line of people waiting - the first person to join the line is the first person to be served."

          { id: 'd', text: 'O(nÂ²)' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'c',
        explanation: "In a Priority Queue implemented as a simple list, removing the highest priority element requires searching through the entire list to find the element with the highest priority, which takes O(n) time. This is because we need to compare each element's priority to find the highest one."

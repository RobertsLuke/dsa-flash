        question: "What additional feature does a Priority Queue have compared to a regular queue?",
        answer: "A Priority Queue extends the queue concept with these features:\n\n1. **Priority Value:**\n   * Each element has an associated priority\n   * Priority determines processing order\n\n2. **Ordering:**\n   * Elements processed by priority, not arrival time\n   * Highest (or lowest) priority served first\n\n3. **Structure:**\n   * Can be implemented with array or heap\n   * Simple implementation uses array with O(n) removal"

        question: "Why is insertion O(1) in a priority queue but deletion O(n)?",
        answer: "**Time Complexity Analysis:**\n\n**Insertion - O(1):**\n* Simply add to end of array\n* No need to maintain order\n* Position doesn't matter\n\n**Deletion - O(n):**\n* Must search all elements\n* Find highest priority element\n* Compare each element's priority\n* No shortcuts without different implementation (like heap)"

        question: "When would you choose a priority queue over a regular queue in real-world applications?",
        answer: "**Priority Queue Use Cases:**\n\n1. **Emergency Services:**\n   * Hospital emergency room triage\n   * Emergency response dispatch\n\n2. **Operating Systems:**\n   * Process scheduling\n   * Job scheduling\n\n3. **Network Management:**\n   * Packet routing (QoS)\n   * Bandwidth allocation\n\n4. **Task Management:**\n   * Task scheduling by importance\n   * Resource allocation"
